A humidity sensor project is designed to measure the amount of moisture present in the air, providing valuable data for various applications like climate control, agriculture, and weather monitoring. The project typically involves using a humidity sensor (such as the DHT11 or DHT22) connected to a microcontroller (like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi). The sensor detects the relative humidity in the air, and the microcontroller processes the data. The measured values are often displayed on an LCD screen, logged for analysis, or sent to a cloud-based system for remote monitoring. This project helps in automating environments like greenhouses, home automation systems, and HVAC systems to maintain optimal conditions.
